Build me a sleek, modern, and bold e-commerce style homepage for a sportswear and combat gear manufacturing brand. 
The style should be inspired by Adidas and Nike: minimal, high-contrast design with bold typography, full-width visuals, and strong call-to-actions. 

Sections needed: 
1. Hero Banner — Full-screen image or video background with tagline: "Engineered for Champions. Trusted Worldwide." + CTA button ("Explore Gear"). 
2. About Us — Short, powerful intro about being in the manufacturing business for over 30 years, supplying global athletes, gyms, and brands. Keep text concise with a supporting image. 
3. Product Categories — Grid layout showcasing product lines (Soccer, Basketball, American Football, 7V7, Baseball). Each card should be clickable. 
4. Featured Clients / Partners — Logos of international brands and gyms we’ve served (use placeholders). Clean, subtle logo strip. 
5. Sustainability & Quality Section — Bold message about craftsmanship, sustainability, and global standards. Use strong imagery. 
6. CTA Section — Minimal bold block: “Let’s Build Your Brand Together” with a button ("Request Catalogue"). 
7. Footer — Simple, dark background with navigation links, contact info, and social icons.

Design Guidelines:
- Colors: Black, White, with one strong accent color (e.g. Red or Electric Blue). 
- Fonts: Bold, sans-serif (like Helvetica Neue / Montserrat). 
- Layout: Minimalist, clean spacing, high visual impact. 
- Style: Premium, athletic, global.
